"""
These tests give FALSE CONFIDENCE:

1. Fast: ‚úÖ (milliseconds)
2. Green: ‚úÖ (all pass)
3. Correct: ‚ùå (lies!)

Why they fail in production:
- No database constraints (UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK)
- No connection errors or timeouts
- No transaction conflicts
- No real database behavior

The solution: TestContainers
- Real database with real constraints
- Tests that actually prove correctness
- Production parity

Run the REAL tests: `pytest tests/test_reality.py -v`
